Golf legends such as Arnold Palmer, Phil Mickelson, Payne Stewart and Nancy Lopez, to name a few, have all carved their way through this historic golf course. Today the legend continues as Arnold Palmer completed a redesign of the original 18-hole Cupp/Stadler layout and added a new nine holes making Starr Pass a 27-hole Championship Golf Course. The course is a true desert experience as all of the hazards are completely natural elements of the environment. The three nines, which wind their way through the mountains and arroyos, are aptly named after the ever-present desert wildlife: Rattler, Road Runner and Coyote. Starr Pass Golf Club was the host facility for the PGA Tour’s Tucson Open from 1988 to 1995.",
