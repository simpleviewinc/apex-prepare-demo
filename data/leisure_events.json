			"description":"The art of hoop dance honors cultural traditions shared by multiple Indigenous communities. With roots in healing ceremonies, traditions and practices, today hoop dance is shared as an artistic expression to celebrate and honor Indigenous traditions throughout the U.S. and Canada.Over the years, as the hoop dance community has grown, dancers have incorporated new and creative designs and intricate footwork while still respecting the fundamentals of the form. Each dancer presents his or her own choreography, weaving in aspects of tradition and culture. Men and women compete on an equal field, and individual routines may feature as few as four to as many as 50 hoops, which are manipulated to create a variety of designs such as animals, insects and globes.Traditional hoops were made from the wood of a willow tree. Modern-day hoops are often made from reed and plastic hose because of the durability of the material when traveling. The hoops are decorated with tape and paint to symbolize the changing colors of each season. The traditional wooden hoops are still used on rare occasions.Dancers are judged on a slate of five skills: precision, timing/rhythm, showmanship, creativity and speed. Contestants compete in one of five divisions: Tiny Tots (age 5 and younger), Youth (6-12), Teen (13-17), Adult (18-39) and Senior (40 and older). Cash prizes totaling $25,000 are awarded to winners in each division, and victors in each division can claim the honor of being the World Champion.Through stunning performances of those women and men competing to be named the next World Champion Hoop Dancer, the event combines artistry, athleticism, tradition and suspense for an unforgettable weekend of fellowship and competition.",

			"description":"The Scottsdale Charros have just announced exciting information about the 70th Annual Scottsdale Parada Del Sol Historic Parade and Trail’s End Festival — including dates, theme and Grand Marshal. The parade and festival are scheduled to take place throughout Old Town Scottsdale on Wednesday, Sep. 3, 2025, beginning with the parade at 10 a.m., with the festival following from noon to 4 p.m.Scottsdale’s own, Oliver Smith Jewelers is this year’s presenting sponsor. This year’s theme 70 Years and Still Groovin’, the Western Cool Vibe, will honor the event as it enters its seventh decade and Barry Goldwater Jr. will serve as Grand Marshal of the festivities. The Scottsdale Parada Del Sol Historic Parade follows a route from Drinkwater Blvd. along Scottsdale Rd. and culminates at Brown Ave. and Indian School Rd. Following the traditional parade, the Trail’s End Festival takes over Scottsdale’s Old Town Historic District for a huge 70s-style block party.We are thrilled that the community continues to embrace the parade and festival as one of the area’s most cherished events, says Chris Chrissy Lyman, president of the Parade Committee for over 40 years of volunteerism with the committee. With the help of the Scottsdale Charros, we look forward to continuing this beloved time-honored tradition for many more years in the future.The Scottsdale Parada Del Sol Historic Parade is one of the longest-running community events in the city with the help of a core group of community volunteers with lifelong experiences of watching and participating in the event. The Scottsdale Charros have been riding in the parade for nearly as long as it has been in existence.When taking on management of the parade in 2021, the Scottsdale Charros committed to making the parade even bigger and better in an effort to be able to raise as much money as possible for the community. The Charros credit the hard work the Parada del Sol Committee, which is made up of volunteers who are dedicated to creating a safe, fun, vibrant community-minded event year after year.Long before its 10 a.m. kick off time, crowds gather along the route to watch the parade’s many floats and participants go by — including approximately 150 entries of colorful floats, mounted horse-riders, horse-drawn carriage, school marching bands, wagons and stagecoaches representing many cultures from Mexican to Native American to Arabian to Western.The Trail’s End Festival takes place immediately following the parade. For this one-of-a-kind daylong street party, Scottsdale’s Historic Old Town District is transformed into a massive family friendly festival featuring a kids’ zone, food trucks, beverage vendors, merchandise, arts and crafts booth and multiple stages with live entertainment including concerts from today’s popular bands as well as traditional performers. Much like the parade, the theme of 70 Years and Still Groovin’, the Western Cool Vibe, will carry through the Trail’s End Festival.Additional event details and complete entertainment lineup will be available soon via scottsdaleparade.com for more information.",

			"description":"The Holland Community Center is proud to host the Adopt-a-Native-Elder Program’s 2nd Annual Scottsdale Navajo Rug & Jewelry Show from July 18-20, 2025. Featuring over 200 traditional handwoven Navajo rugs, jewelry and crafts for sale, as well as weaving demonstrations, stories, cultural teachings and raffles, the Show will offer attendees an opportunity to purchase one-of-a-kind items while gaining deeper insight into Native culture. The weekend will begin with a VIP preview and sale on Friday, Jul. 18 from 5-8 p.m., allowing attendees an early chance to view and purchase rugs and other handcrafted items before the Show opens to the public. On Saturday and Sunday, Jul. 19-20, the Show will run from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day; admission is free, and all proceeds from rug sales will directly support the weavers. The Featured Weaver of this year’s Navajo Rug & Jewelry Show is Nellie Curley, who is known for incorporating cultural teachings into each of her rugs. Through her weavings, Nellie tells the Creation Story of her homelands and showcases various Navajo ceremonies in rich detail. Several of her rugs will be available for purchase at the Show. Attendees will also have a special opportunity to watch weaving demonstrations and meet several of the weavers and artisans who created the rugs and other items available for purchase.

Recordings such as Biggie’s Juicy, Hypnotize and Who Shot Ya and Tupac’s Changes, Ghetto Gospel and California Love are interpolated in thematically-linked mashups that speak of hard roads, ravaged communities, gangster life and letting loose.

The goal of Tai Chi is to find balance between these forces, both within the individual and in the world around them.Join Rasoul Amin Sobhani in practicing the art of Tai Chi, which uses the mind, body, and spirit equally to engage in collective meditation.
