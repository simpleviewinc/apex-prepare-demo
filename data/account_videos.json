Join us as we revisit some of the best parts of this amazing place.\n\n\nThis amazing museum is a bit different than your ordinary walkthrough. The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is ranked as one of the top 10 museums in the country according to tripadvisor.com and roughly 85% of the experience is outside!\n\nWhen visiting, you can walk through nearly two miles of desert habitats and see native animals, plant life, and regional minerals. \n\nAnimal habitats include an aquarium, riparian exhibit, reptile hall, walk-in aviary, woodland life, pollination garden, cat canyon, and mountain woodland life.\n\nThe site offers multiple dining establishments - Ironwood Terraces, a quick-service food court as well as the Ocotillo Caf√©, a casual dining full-service restaurant. In addition, there are Phoebe's Coffee Bar and The Cottonwood, each offering hot and cold drinks as well as sandwiches or ice cream treats. \n\nWhile much of the museum is a walking experience, wheelchairs and strollers are available as well as rent-able electric scooters.  \n\n\nVIDEO FILMED: 02/05/2022",
